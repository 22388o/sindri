# Sindri

A Python package to receive, process, store, monitor and serve science data and status information on a server from remote HAMMA sensor clients; i.e. those running the ``brokkr`` package.
Part of Project Mjolnir, a system to allow remote monitoring, control and data uplink from multiple networks of HAMMA2 lightning sensors.
See the built-in help of the ``sindri`` command this package installs for more details on basic usage and functionality.



## Installation and Setup

Built and tested under Python 3.7 (but should be compatible with Python >=3.6; lack thereof should be considered a bug) and recent (>= 2019) versions of the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
Works best on Linux, but is tested to be fully functional (aside from service features) on Windows (and _should_ work equally macOS) under the Anaconda distribution.
