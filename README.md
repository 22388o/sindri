# Sindri

A Python package to receive, process, store, monitor and serve science data and status information on a server from remote Brokkr and Ivaldi clients.
Part of Project Mjolnir, a system to allow remote monitoring, control and data uplink from multiple networks of scientific IoT sensors.
See the built-in help of the ``sindri`` command this package installs for more details on basic usage and functionality.



## Installation and Setup

Built and tested under Python 3.7 (but should be compatible with Python >=3.6; lack thereof should be considered a bug), and should be forward-compatible with Python 3.8 (albeit as yet not fully tested).
Compatible and tested with recent (>= 2019) versions of the packages listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file.
Works best on Linux, but is tested to be fully functional (aside from service features) on Windows (and _should_ work equally macOS) under the Anaconda distribution.
